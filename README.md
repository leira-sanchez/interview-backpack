# Introduction

As part of Backpack’s application process we would like to see a sample of your work. This prompt should take between 10 - 15 hours to complete.

## Prompt

Backpack is a financial institution that at its core deals with bank accounts, balances, and transactions. In this prompt you will build a UI that displays a customer’s bank account and routing numbers, available and pending balances, and transactions.

Please create a separate repository for this prompt and commit your work as you go. When you are ready for us to review your work, give us access to your repository.

If you have any questions please ask!
